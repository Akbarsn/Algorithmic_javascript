__Algorithms practiced using JS__

## List of problems
1. String reversing  
2. Vowel counter 

## Explanation
<bold> 1. String reversing </bold>
 <p>The string reversal algorithm is perhaps the most common JavaScript code challenge on the internet. In this article, we explore various string reversal techniques as a good number of string manipulation algorithms are dependent on ones ability to reverse a string. </p> <br>

__The challenge:__ Given a string of text, write an algorithm that returns the text received in a reversed format. E.g

<hr>

```js
 reverseString('algorithm')
 // should return "mhtirogla"
```

>reverseString('algorithms') 
    >should return 'smhtirogla

<hr>
